#Speech Therapy Sandbox: Ideas for Articulation Elicitation

This application provides a variety of sound cards to target with speech therapy clients diagnosed with 
speech sound or phonological disorders. Each sound card contains a word list to target, recommended
book, and link to book read aloud to use in therapy sessions. The SLP can also add sound cards to target, 
which come in handy to individualize each session. To handle user input errors, error handling is added 
for word list input. 

To provide positive reinforcement with additional articulation practice, there is a game page with
links to games based on targeted sound. 

This is a React.js application which uses JSX components to easily update and render onto the page.
