   <p className="home">My name is Staci Rosales and I've been a Speech-Language Pathologist for 7 years. I graduated from the University of Oklahoma HSC with a Master's in Speech-Language Pathology in 2015. I have been working with school-age clients since I graduated and found that targeting articulation within literacy activities to be the most effective for generalization in the classroom. This website will offer a variety of targets with recommended books as well as links to games to provide positive reinforcement.</p>
